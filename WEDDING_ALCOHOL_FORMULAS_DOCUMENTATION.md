# Wedding Alcohol Calculator - Formulas & Documentation

## Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive documentation of all formulas, assumptions, data sources, and calculation methodologies used in the Advanced Wedding Alcohol Calculator. All calculations are based on industry standards, research data, and professional wedding planning best practices.

## Core Calculation Formula

### Base Consumption Formula
```
Total Alcoholic Drinks = (Light Drinkers × Light Rate × Duration × Adjustments) +
                        (Moderate Drinkers × Moderate Rate × Duration × Adjustments) +
                        (Heavy Drinkers × Heavy Rate × Duration × Adjustments) +
                        First Hour Boost
```

Where:
- **Light Rate**: 0.5 drinks per person per hour
- **Moderate Rate**: 0.8 drinks per person per hour
- **Heavy Rate**: 1.2 drinks per person per hour
- **First Hour Boost**: 40% of total consumption (people drink double in first hour)

## Environmental & Event Adjustments

### Venue Type Multipliers
- **Indoor Events**: 1.0 (baseline)
- **Outdoor Events**: 1.15 (+15% consumption)
- **Mixed Indoor/Outdoor**: 1.08 (+8% consumption)

### Temperature Adjustments
- **Above 80°F**: 1.2 multiplier (+20%)
- **70-80°F**: 1.1 multiplier (+10%)
- **50-70°F**: 1.0 multiplier (baseline)
- **Below 50°F**: 0.9 multiplier (-10%)

*Rationale: Higher temperatures increase thirst and alcohol consumption, particularly for beer and wine*

### Event Style Multipliers
- **Cocktail Reception**: 1.3 multiplier (+30%)
- **Seated Dinner**: 0.8 multiplier (-20%)
- **Buffet Style**: 1.0 multiplier (baseline)
- **Mixed Service**: 1.0 multiplier (baseline)

### Seasonal Consumption Patterns
| Season | Alcoholic Multiplier | Non-Alcoholic Multiplier |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Spring | 1.0                 | 1.1                     |
| Summer | 1.1                 | 1.3                     |
| Fall   | 1.05                | 1.0                     |
| Winter | 1.15                | 0.9                     |

*Based on seasonal beverage consumption data from Beverage Industry Magazine*

## Serving Size Standards

### Alcohol Servings per Container
- **Wine**: 5 servings per 750ml bottle
- **Beer**: 1 serving per bottle/can
- **Spirits**: 30 servings per 1.75L handle
- **Champagne**: 8 servings per 750ml bottle

### Non-Alcoholic Beverages
- **Water**: 1 serving per bottle, 24 bottles per case
- **Soft Drinks**: 1 serving per can, 12 cans per pack
- **Coffee**: 10 servings per batch service

## Special Occasion Adjustments

### Champagne Toast Calculation
```
Champagne Bottles Needed = Total Guests ÷ 8
```
*Assumes one toast per guest with 4oz pours*

### First Hour Consumption Boost
```
First Hour Boost = Total Calculated Drinks × 0.4
```
*Research shows guests consume approximately 2 drinks in the first hour vs. 1 drink per hour thereafter*

## Non-Alcoholic Beverage Calculations

### Water Requirements
```
Water Servings = Total Guests × Event Duration × 1.5
```
*Medical recommendation: 12oz water per guest every 30-60 minutes*

### Soft Drink Calculations
```
Soft Drink Servings = (Total Guests × Duration × 0.75) × Seasonal Multiplier × 0.6
```
*60% of non-alcoholic beverages are typically soft drinks*

### Coffee Service
```
Coffee Servings = Total Guests × 0.8
```
*Assumes 80% of guests will want coffee service*

## Cost Calculation Methodology

### Location-Based Pricing Multipliers
| Location | Cost Multiplier | Tax Rate |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| New York, NY | 1.3 | 8.0% |
| Los Angeles, CA | 1.25 | 9.5% |
| Chicago, IL | 1.1 | 10.0% |
| Miami, FL | 1.15 | 7.0% |
| Austin, TX | 0.9 | 6.25% |
| Denver, CO | 0.95 | 7.7% |
| Other Markets | 1.0 | 8.0% |

### Base Price Assumptions (Before Location Adjustment)
- **Beer**: $2.50 per bottle
- **Wine**: $12.00 per bottle
- **Champagne**: $25.00 per bottle
- **Spirits**: $30.00 per 1.75L bottle
- **Soft Drinks**: $1.50 per 12-pack
- **Water**: $0.75 per case
- **Coffee Service**: $3.00 per 10-person batch

*Prices based on wholesale/bulk purchasing data from major distributors*

### Total Cost Calculation
```
Subtotal = Sum of all beverage costs × Location Multiplier
Tax = Subtotal × Local Tax Rate
Delivery Fee = $50 if Subtotal < $500, otherwise $0
Total Cost = Subtotal + Tax + Delivery Fee
```

## Buffer & Waste Calculations

### Recommended Buffer
```
Buffer Amount = Total Calculated Drinks × 0.15
```
*15% buffer recommended by wedding industry professionals*

### Leftover Estimation
- **Wine**: 10% of bottles typically remain unopened
- **Beer**: 5% typically remain unopened
- **Spirits**: Minimal waste due to longer shelf life

## Timeline & Service Planning

### Hourly Consumption Distribution
- **Hour 1**: 2.0x normal rate (peak consumption)
- **Hours 2-3**: 1.2x normal rate (elevated consumption)
- **Hours 4+**: 1.0x normal rate (steady consumption)

### Service Staff Recommendations
- **Cocktail Events**: 1 bartender per 50 guests
- **Beer & Wine Only**: 1 server per 75 guests
- **Full Bar Service**: 1 bartender per 40 guests
